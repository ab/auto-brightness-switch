Auto Brightness Switch
======================

Auto Brightness Switch is a dead-simple Android application that toggles the
system's auto-brightness setting. I like to keep the backlight brightness at
minimum when indoors to save battery, but this makes the screen illegible
outside on a nice sunny day.

The app saves the last manually set brightness level when enabling auto
brightness and returns to that level when disabling auto brightness. Inspired
by Kenneth Cheng's excellent
[AutoRotate Switch](https://market.android.com/details?id=kennethcheng.com.autorotate),
it is not a widget in order to save memory. You can also launch it with a
long-press on the search button.

Patches and translations are welcome.
